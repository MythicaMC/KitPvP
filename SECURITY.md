## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please send an email to `security@mythicamc.com` or use the GitHub [report vulnerability feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to report a vulnerability.

We try to respond to every report as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two for us to determine the severity of the report and its impact. Please, do not use a public facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues.

As part of our process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually two to four weeks after a releasing a version that addresses it.
